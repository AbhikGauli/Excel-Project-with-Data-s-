## 🔎 Introduction  
As someone eager to enter the data field, I wanted to explore how Excel can be used beyond the basics—by applying it to real-world data to uncover meaningful insights.  

This project combines an **interactive salary dashboard** with **analytical deep dives** into the 2023 data jobs market. I was curious to find out:  

1. Do more skills actually lead to higher pay?  
2. How do salaries vary across countries and regions?  
3. Which technical skills are most in demand?  
4. What’s the salary impact of the top 10 skills?  

My goal was to sharpen my Excel and data analysis abilities while also learning more about the field I aim to build a career in.

## 🛠️ Excel & BI Skills Applied  

- 📊 **PivotTables & PivotCharts** – salary and skill breakdowns  
- 📈 **Advanced Charts** – bar charts, combo charts, geographic map charts  
- 🔍 **Power Query** – extracting, cleaning, and shaping datasets  
- 💪 **Power Pivot & Data Modeling** – connecting multiple tables and relationships  
- 🧮 **DAX** – creating custom measures (e.g., median salary by filters)  
- ✅ **Data Validation** – drop-down selectors for cleaner user input  

This project shows how I can use Excel like a **business intelligence tool**, not just a spreadsheet.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains real-world 2023 job postings in the data field, with information on:  

- 👨‍💻 Job titles  
- 💰 Salaries (annual averages)  
- 🌍 Locations  
- 🛠️ Skills required

## 📊 Analysis & Insights  

### 1️⃣ Do more skills = higher salary?  
- I used **Power Query** to clean job and skill data.  
- Built a relationship model in **Power Pivot** linking job listings with their required skills.  

💡 **Finding:** Roles demanding multiple technical skills (like *Senior Data Engineer* or *Data Scientist*) pay significantly higher. Jobs requiring fewer skills (e.g., Business Analyst) offered lower salaries.  

📈 **Insight:** Specialization combined with multiple in-demand skills drives salary growth.  

---

### 2️⃣ Salary Differences by Region  
- Built **PivotTables** and **DAX measures** for median salaries across countries.  
- Created a **Map Chart** to visually compare regions.  

💡 **Finding:** Salaries in the US are consistently higher, particularly in senior tech roles, while other regions show competitive but more varied pay.  

📊 **Insight:** Geography remains a major factor in career planning for data roles.  

---

### 3️⃣ What are the top in-demand skills?  
- Using **Power Pivot**, I connected job and skill tables to analyze frequency and demand.  

💡 **Finding:**  
- **SQL and Python** dominate as *must-have skills*.  
- **Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)** are rapidly increasing in demand.  
- Non-technical tools (PowerPoint, Word) correlated with the lowest-paying roles.  

📊 **Insight:** Mastering Python, SQL, and cloud tools is critical for building a competitive edge.  

---

### 4️⃣ What’s the pay for the top 10 skills?  
- Built a **combo PivotChart** plotting *median salary* (columns) against *skill frequency* (line).  

💡 **Finding:**  
- High-value skills like **Python, SQL, Oracle** are strongly linked to higher salaries.  
- Lower-value skills (Word, PowerPoint) show little correlation with pay.  

📊 **Insight:** Investing in specialized, technical skills clearly pays off.  

---

## 📉 Dashboard Features  

I also created a clean and interactive **Excel dashboard**:  

- 📊 **Role vs. Salary (Bar Chart)** – sorted by median salary for clarity  
- 🌍 **Country Map Chart** – global salary comparisons  
- ⏱️ **Job Schedule Types** – extracted and cleaned via formulas  
- ✅ **Data Validation Filters** – drop-downs for job title, country, and type  

This turns the analysis into a **hands-on tool** anyone can use to explore the data.  

---

## 🎯 Conclusion  

By combining **Power Query, Power Pivot, DAX, and advanced charts**, I was able to transform raw job postings into meaningful insights:  

- Salaries increase with both specialization and the number of skills.  
- The US leads in compensation, but skill-driven salaries are rising globally.  
- Python, SQL, and cloud skills are essential for higher-paying roles.  

This project reflects my eagerness to **enter the data field** and shows how I approach data: not just as numbers, but as a story about skills, opportunities, and growth.
